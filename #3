Programming Practice 3
     <Reflection 1 What were you trying to learn or achieve?>
        I wanted to learn about functions and loops. I was also writing some reinforced prototypes.I was shhowing a function could be prototyped before it is defined. I was attempting to learn how to use loops within loops as well.
    <Reflection 2 Were you successful? Why or Why not?>
         My code ended up working pretty well, mostly because I got a lot of TA help on this. My code compiled successfully after some minor refining due to simple mistakes such as certain typing errors due to writing along as I thought without being careful. 
    <Reflection 3 Would you do anything differently if starting this program over? If so, explain what.>
       Originally If anything I would have used fewer if statements, but I reduced my number by the end of the program by using two more variables, chk_h and chk_w. If I had to do something over I would make the program print a pyramid/triange shape rather than just a square.
    <Reflection 4 Think about the most important thing you learned when writing this piece of code. What was it and explain why it was significant.>
        I learned to pay attention to subtle differences in variable names when typing out statements rapidly. Even if a quick solution is desired, taking ones time is always worth the effort. The experience was significant because it caused my code to not run in certain scenarios, chk_h and chk_w were typo'd a few times as chk_h where chk_w should have been originally in the if statement. 
<Other questions/comments for Instructors>
        None.
